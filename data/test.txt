My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent.  
The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their 
grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food 
arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  
It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you 
get here the better.
